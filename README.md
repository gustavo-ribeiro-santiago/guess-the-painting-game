# Guess the Painting Game

## Description

Welcome to the Guess the Painting Game! This project is a fun and interactive game that challenges your knowledge of famous paintings and artists. Test your art history skills by identifying the names of famous paintings and their creators.

In this game, you will be presented with a partially obscured painting, and your goal is to guess the name of the painting and the artist who created it. The catch is that the more of the painting you reveal, the fewer points you can earn.

## How to play

1. When you start the game, you'll see a partially hidden painting on the screen.

2. Click on the "Show more of the painting" button to reveal more of the artwork. You can click this button multiple times until the painting is fully revealed.

3. Below the painting, you will also see a list of possible options for the painting's name and artist.

4. Click on the option that you think is correct. If you're correct, you'll earn points based on how much of the painting you've revealed.

5. Keep playing and trying to earn as many points as possible.

6. The game ends when you've guessed all of the 12 paintings.

## Scoring

Your score is calculated based on the following criteria:

- Each round has a potential maximum score based on how much of the painting you've revealed.
- If you've guessed it correctly without revealing any more of the painting, you will earn 1000 points.
- After each click to show more of the painting, your potential score for the round decreases 250 points.
- After 3 clicks, the painting is fully revealed and you can only earn 250 points if you choose its name and artist correctly.
- Your total score is the sum of the scores from all the rounds you've played.
